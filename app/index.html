                  I am currently starting a new internship with Montreal-based company Jonar, and will be working for their research and development team in further developing

                  During my time at Verafin, I worked alongside the security development team and was responsible for 
                  scripting, testing and deploying configuration rules in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) production environment.
                  Many of the config rules I scripted focused around security audits that determined if resources in the AWS environment (e.g., EC2 Instances, 
                  S3 Buckets, ELBs, etc) were configured correctly and securely, ultimately ensuring that internal/customer data was not public-facing. Additionally,
                  I created Lambda scripts to audit the AWS Key Management System to determine all entities that had descryption privaledge, or entities that could 
                  grant descryption priviledge. Key technologies used were: <strong>Python, and AWS.</strong>

                    During my master's, I was invited by a fellow lab mate to help prototype the front-end of a project himself and a few colleagues were working on.
                    I was tasked with taking a Photoshop markup of GradLounge's main page and code design. Through this project, I was able to familiarize myself with
                    the Bootstrap framework, jQuery, and the basics of HTML and CSS. Addtionally, I was introduced to the popular Python web framework Flask. key
                    technologies used were: <strong>Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, jQuery, JavaScript.</strong>

                    My master’s studies consisted of researching modern clinical neuroscience, and conducting experiments using electroencephalography

                    worked in an optogenetic lab, where I performed cranial surgeries on mice which involved the injection of viral-vectored, light-sensitive proteins, 
                    as well as fibre optic neural implants.
